# Linux Deep Dive

+ This repository contains notes on what I learn about Linux. I aim to go deep into each concept.
+ The notes are not in a strict order, but related topics are grouped in the same directory.
+ Files and directories use clear, descriptive names to make topics easy to find.
+ This does not cover everything about Linux. I update the repository as I continue learning.

Feel free to open an issue if you find incorrect or outdated information, or if you want to suggest new topics.
