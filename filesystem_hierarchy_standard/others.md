# Other Root Directories

## `/home`; User Home Directories

### Purpose and Role

`/home` is the canonical location for **non-privileged users’ personal data and settings**. Under FHS, this directory is designated for individual user subdirectories such as `/home/alice`, `/home/bob`, etc., and is typically mounted as a separate filesystem on systems with multiple partitions to preserve user data independently of the root filesystem

### Conceptual Details

* Contains user personal files, configuration settings stored in hidden dotfiles (e.g., `~/.bashrc`), and workspace data.
* Administrators may partition `/home` separately to isolate variable user content from system-critical paths.
* Regular user processes and applications read/write data here under user permissions.

### Key Observations

* `/home` is **not essential for booting**; the system can operate without it (e.g., single-user mode), but missing user directories affect multi-user interactive sessions

## `/root`; Superuser Home Directory

### Purpose and Role

`/root` is the **home directory of the superuser (root account)**. Despite superficial resemblance to `/home/root`, it is placed directly in the root filesystem to ensure availability even when `/home` is on a separate partition that may not yet be mounted during early boot

### Conceptual Details

* Reserved for use by the **system administrator** for tasks that require elevated privileges.
* Contains root-specific configuration files and potentially scripts or administrative notes.

### Key Observations

* The name similarity with the root directory (`/`) can cause conceptual confusion; `/root` is distinct and specific to the root user.

## `/opt`; Optional Add-On Application Software

### Purpose and Role

`/opt` is designated for **optional and third-party software packages** that are not part of the core distribution. Unlike package manager-managed locations (e.g., `/usr/bin`), software in `/opt` typically resides in its own subdirectory tree and is self-contained.

### Conceptual Details

* Typical layout:
  `/opt/<package>/bin`, `/opt/<package>/lib`, `/opt/<package>/share`, etc.
* Facilitates installation of proprietary and large self-contained applications without conflicting with managed system paths.

### Key Observations

* FHS recommends that packages in `/opt` include all static components within a subdirectory hierarchy so that removal or upgrade does not affect other parts of the filesystem.

## `/proc`; Process and Kernel Information (Pseudo-Filesystem)

### Purpose and Role

`/proc` is a **virtual/procfs filesystem** dynamically generated by the kernel at runtime. It does not contain physical files on disk; rather, it supplies an interface to kernel data structures and process metadata.

### Conceptual Details

* Standard entries include:

  * `/proc/<pid>/`; Directories representing each process
  * `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/cpuinfo`; System memory and CPU information
  * `/proc/sys/`; Tunable kernel parameters exposed via sysctl
* Programs and scripts parse text files in `/proc` to obtain real-time system and process information, obviating the need to read kernel memory directly.

### Key Observations

* Because `/proc` is ephemeral and generated on mount, it requires no persistence across reboots and exists only when the system is running.

## `/lost+found`; Recovered Files Root

### Purpose and Role

`/lost+found` is not specified by FHS but is a **filesystem-specific construct** created automatically by filesystem utilities (such as `fsck`) on filesystems like ext2/ext3/ext4.

### Conceptual Details

* It serves as a **repository for orphaned filesystem objects** that the consistency checker recovers when filesystem corruption (such as power failure or metadata inconsistency) occurs.
* Files in `/lost+found` are typically renamed to unstructured numeric names; subsequent manual inspection is necessary to restore them to meaningful locations.

### Key Observations

* Presence of `/lost+found` can assist in post-failure forensic recovery but does not contain application or system configuration under normal operation.

---

## `/srv`; Data Served by System Services

### Purpose and Role

`/srv` is standardized by FHS to contain **site-specific service data** intended to be accessed or served by daemons and network services.

### Conceptual Details

* Typical substructure may reflect service names or protocols, such as:

  * `/srv/www/` for web server document roots
  * `/srv/ftp/` for FTP service content
  * `/srv/git/` or `/srv/svn/` for version control repositories
* By centralizing service content under `/srv`, administrators can manage service data separately from application binaries and system configuration.

### Key Observations

* FHS does not prescribe specific layout conventions within `/srv`, but it strongly implies that service-related data reside here rather than in ad-hoc locations.

---

## `/tmp`; Temporary Files

### Purpose and Role

`/tmp` is designated as a **temporary storage location** for programs and users to create transient files. Under FHS, it must be globally writable and suitable for short-lived data.

### Conceptual Details

* Files in `/tmp` may be removed at any time by the system or administrators, and many systems clear this directory at boot.
* It is typically mounted with restrictive permissions (e.g., sticky bit set) to prevent unauthorized deletion of other users’ files.

### Key Observations

* Programs must not rely on persistence of `/tmp` files across reboots, and they should use predictable temporary file naming conventions to avoid collisions and security risks.
